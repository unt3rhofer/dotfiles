# Introduction
This repository was originally just a place where I stored my dotfiles as a backup, but after about a year of googling, reading all kinds of documentation, posting countless questions on Reddit, and having many arguments with ChatGPT on how things should be done, I have decided to compile a list of resources, tutorials, common issues, and general tips & tricks that I learned about on my _endeavors_. I will try my best to keep the [wiki](https://github.com/unt3rhofer/Dotfiles/wiki) organized and coherent but that might not always turn out to be the case.

The [wiki](https://github.com/unt3rhofer/Dotfiles/wiki) will primarily cover setting up, optimizing and refining the i3 window manager and take you through basic initialization steps after a fresh install of Arch linux.
